You are allowed to use this software to build your website.

You are allowed to make changes to this software, provided you don't package and redistribute
them without permission. This is a version control thing more than anything else. I'd rather 
not there be 1000 versions of this Web Builder all with minor tweaks. Again, if you can make it
better or more custom, by all means go ahead. Just don't give the modified version to people.
Please point them to the original code instead.

You are allowed to create your own modules. Even if they completely depend on Web Builder to 
run, they are still absolutely your code. Do whatever you want with them. If you think lots of 
people will find them useful, feel free to post them on github or similar platforms.

If you have a feature that you think everyone will like/benefit from, you can make your own
module and put it there, or consider contacting me and contributing. Just please don't create
your own packaged version.

This software is given AS IS. No warrenty is expressed or implied. If it's
broken, out of the package or otherwise, I'm not obligated to fix it. That said, feel free to
open an issue if you have a bug.

One final thing: You can do anything within reason with this code, comercial or otherwise, 
provided you honor my wishes about version control. If you have any other questions not 
covered here, you can email me at rev20-10@psalm126.com, or open an issue on Github.
